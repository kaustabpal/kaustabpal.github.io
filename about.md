**TLDR:** I am a MS by research student associated with the Robotics Research Center at
IIITH. My work is focused on trajectory optimization for autonomous vehicles.
I enjoy learning and experimenting with new things and this blog is meant to be
a documentation of my experiences. 

> NOTE: This blog looks best on a desktop screen. I am working on optimizing it for the
mobile screen but I am not sure when that will be done.
