<p>When we open nvim, what we see is a window in a tab. The window is the viewport
that holds the buffers. When we open a file, we are actually copying the
contents of the file onto a buffer and when we make changes to that copy and 
write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:w</code>, the contents of the buffer is written in that file thus changing
it. When we open multiple files each file will open in itâ€™s own buffer. The 
window will display only the active buffer while the other buffers will be hidden. 
We can check the files in the buffers with the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">buffers</code>. We can switch to
a buffer with the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:b&lt;buffer number&gt;</code>. To close the active
buffer we use the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:bd</code>. To close a hidden buffer we use the command
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:bd&lt;buffer number&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>A tab can have multiple windows. Thus in a tab we can have multiple windows open
through horizontal split <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:hsplit</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:split</code> or vertical split
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:vsplit</code>.</p>
