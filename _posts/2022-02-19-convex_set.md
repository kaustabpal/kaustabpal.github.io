A set $$C$$ is called a convex set if it contains all the [ [Convex Combination]
]( {% post_url 2022-02-19-convex_combination %} ) of the points in that set.
Given a set $$C$$, we can make it convex by taking the [ [Convex Hull] ]( {%
post_url 2022-02-19-convex_hull %} ) of the set.

Examples of Convex Sets:
1. Empty set $$\{\emptyset \}$$ 
2. Singleton (A set containing a single point)
3. The whole $$R^n$$ space.
4. [ [Hyperplane] ]( {% post_url 2022-02-28-hyperplane %} )
