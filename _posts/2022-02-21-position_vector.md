Any point in the universe can be located with a $$3 \times 1$$ vector known as the position
vector represented as:

$$P = \begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \\ z\end{bmatrix}$$

Given a position vector we can say which coordinate system the vector belongs to
by writing the vector as $$^{A}P$$. Here the vector $$P$$ belongs to the
coordinate system $$A$$.

ach component of vector $$^AP$$ tells us the distances along the axes of the
coordinate system it belongs to.
