The conic hull of a set is the set containing all the [ [Conic Combinations] ](
{% post_url 2022-02-19-conic_combination %} ) of the elements of the set. The
conic hull of a set $$C$$ is the smallest [ [Convex Cone] ]( {% post_url
2022-02-19-convex_cone %} ) but it is not the smallest [ [Cone] ]( {% post_url
2022-02-19-cone%} ) containing the set. If we turn $$C$$ into a cone then that
set will be the smallest cone containing $$C$$. Also if a given set is a cone,
then the [ [Convex Hull] ]( {% post_url 2022-02-19-convex_hull %} ) and the
conic hull of the set will be the same.
