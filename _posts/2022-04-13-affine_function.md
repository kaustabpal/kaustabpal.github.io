A function is called an affine function if the domain of the function is an
affine set and if for all $$x,y \in \boldsymbol{dom} f$$ and $$\theta$$ with $$0 \leq \theta \leq
1$$, we have 

$$ f(\theta x + (1-\theta) y) = \theta f(x) + (1-\theta) f(y)$$

An affine funciton is both a [ [Convex Function] ]( {% post_url

is both convex and concave it is an affine function.
