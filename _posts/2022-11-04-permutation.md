If we have a set of $$N$$ elements, permutation tells us the number of ways we
can order the set of $$N$$ elements.

If a set contains $$N$$ elements, and we want to know what are the ways we can
order them, then there are $$N$$ choices for the first element, $$N-1$$ choices
for the second element and so on. We can write them as $$N \times (N-1) \times
(N-2) \times \dots \times 1 = N!$$.

If there are $$N$$ elements in a set and we want to know the number of subsets
we can make, then we have $$2$$ choices for the first element, $$2$$ choices for
the second element and so on for all the $$N$$ elements. Thus we will have
$$2^N$$ subsets from a set containing $$N$$ elements.
