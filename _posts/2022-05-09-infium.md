Let $$S$$ be a set of real numbers. If there exists a real number $$b$$ such
that $$x\geq b$$ for every $$x \in S$$, then $$b$$ is called a lower bound for
$$S$$ and we say that $$S$$ is bounded below by $$b$$. 

* *We say "a" lower bound because any number less than $$b$$ will also be a
  lower bound.*

* *If $$b$$ is also an element of $$S$$ then it is called the minimum element of
  $$S$$.*

* *A set with no lower bound is called unbounded below.*

The infimum of the set $$S$$ is the greatest of all the upperbounds of the set.
It is denoted as $$inf(S)$$
