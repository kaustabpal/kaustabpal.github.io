Vectors $$\boldsymbol{v_1}, \boldsymbol{v_2}, \dots \boldsymbol{v_n}$$ are
called linearly independent if the [ [Linear Combination] ]( {% post_url
2022-02-28-linear_combination %} )of these vectors is $$0$$ only if the
coefficients of the linear combination are all $$0$$. If the linear combination
of these vectors are $$0$$ for coefficients which are not all $$0$$, then the
vectors are said to be dependent. 

If the vectors are column vectors of a matrix
$$A$$, then the columns of the matrix are said to be independent if
$$A\boldsymbol{x}=0$$ only when $$\boldsymbol{x}=0$$. Geometrically, vectors are
said to be independent if they do not lie on the same line/plane.
