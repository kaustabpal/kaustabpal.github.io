## Definition

Model Predictive Control refers to a class of control methods where the model of
the process is used to obtain the control signal up to $$N$$ timesteps in the
future such that there is a duration of $$dt$$ seconds between each timestep.
The control signal is obtained by minimizing an objective function while
satisfying a set of constraints and only the first control is used after which
we optimize again for the next $$N$$ timesteps. Usually the main differences
between the various MPC algorithms are in the model used to represent the
process, the cost function and the set of constraints.

The MPC consists of two important blocks:
1. The model: The model used to represent the process must be able to capture
   the dynamics of the process while being simple enough to be implemented and
   understand.
2. The optimizer: The optimizer used to minimise the cost function also plays an
   important role in getting the optimal controls and the quality of the
   controls also depends on the optimizer used and the formulation of the cost
   function.
