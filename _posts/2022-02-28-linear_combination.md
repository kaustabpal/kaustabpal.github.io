Given two vectors $$\boldsymbol{v_{1}}$$ and $$\boldsymbol{v_2}$$ and scalars
$$\lambda_1$$ and $$\lambda_2$$, the sum $$\lambda_1 \boldsymbol{v_1}+\lambda_2
\boldsymbol{v_2}$$ is called a linear combination of the vectors
$$\boldsymbol{v_1}$$ and $$\boldsymbol{v_2}$$. The scalars $$\lambda_1$$ and
$$\lambda_2$$ are called the coefficients of the linear combination. 

If vectors
$$\boldsymbol{v_1}$$ and $$\boldsymbol{v_2}$$ are column vectors of a matrix
$$A$$ and vector $$\boldsymbol{x}=\begin{bmatrix}\lambda_1 &
\lambda_2\end{bmatrix}^T$$, then $$A\boldsymbol{x}$$ gives us the linear
combination of the column vectors of the matrix $$A$$ where the coefficients of
the linear combination are the values of the vector $$\boldsymbol{x}$$.
