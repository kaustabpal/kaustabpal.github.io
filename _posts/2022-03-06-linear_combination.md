Given two vectors $$v_1$$ and $$v_2$$ and two scalers $$\lambda_1$$ and
$$\lambda_2$$, the sum $$\lambda_1 v_1 + \lambda_2 v_2$$ is called the linear
combination of the vectors $$v_1$$ and $$v_2$$. The scalers $$\lambda_1$$ and
$$\lambda_2$$ are called the coefficients of the linear combination.

If the vectors $$v_1$$ and $$v_2$$ are column vectors of a matrix $$A$$, then
the vector $$x = \begin{bmatrix}v_1 & v_2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}\lambda_1
\\ \lambda_2 \end{bmatrix}$$ gives us the linear combination if the column
vectors with the coefficients $$\lambda_1$$ and $$\lambda_2$$.
