A set $$C$$ is said to be an affine set if the [ [Affine Combination] ]( {%
post_url 2022-02-19-affine_ocmbination %} ) of any points in the set belongs to
the set. An affine set will always be a [ [Convex Set]]( {% post_url
2022-02-19-convex_set %} ) as the affine combination also contains the 
[ [Convex Combination] ]( {% post_url 2022-02-19-convex_combination %} )but the
vice versa isn't true.
