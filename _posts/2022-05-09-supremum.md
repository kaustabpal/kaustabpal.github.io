Let $$S$$ be a set of real numbers. If there exists a real number $$b$$ such
that $$x\leq b$$ for every $$x \in S$$, then $$b$$ is called an upper bound for
$$S$$ and we say that $$S$$ is bounded above by $$b$$. 

* *We say "an" upper bound because any number greater than $$b$$ will also be an
upper bound.*

* *If $$b$$ is also an element of $$S$$ then it is called the maximum element of
  $$S$$.*

* *A set with no upper bound is called unbounded above.*

The supremum of the set $$S$$ is the least of all the upperbounds of the set. It
is denoted as $$sup(S)$$
