## Introduction

Autonomous robots having a non-holonomic kinematics motion model results in a
non-linear mapping between the control inputs and the states. Trajectory
optimization problems with such motion models takes the form of a challenging
non-linear programming problem (NLP).

Model Predictive Controls are good at solving this non-linear trajectory
optimization problem. Here we use the model of the vehicle to predict the
controls of the vehicle upto $$T$$ timesteps into the future. The control signals
are usually obtained by minimizing an objective function while satisfying a set
of constraints. 

Usually techniques like sequential quadratic programming (SQP) are used
to obtain a locally optimal solution. But it requires that we convexify the
non-linear and non-convex trajectory optimization problem. We do this by
linearizing the system model incorporating the path constraints including
collision avoidance constraints by introducing them as penalty terms in the
objective functions. These linear approximations may often lead to infeasible
solutions resulting in collisions with the obstacles.

The paper "An nmpc approach using convex inner approximations for online motion
planning with guaranteed collision avoidance” (CIAO) proposed the use of convex inner
approximations to plan the trajectories. The Convex Inner Approximation method
finds kinodynamically feasible trajectories that guarantees collision avoidance.
It also finds the trajectories in fewer iterations and as a result is much
faster.

For my Google Summer of Code 2022 project with the Robocomp organization, I
proposed and implemented the CIAO paper in their optimizer component for an indoor
robot navigation scenario. The final result is a robot that is able to navigate
in complex narrow corridors while avoiding static and dynamic obstacles.

## Formulation

The state configuration of the vehicle is represented as the vector
$$\begin{bmatrix}x_t, y_t, \theta_t\end{bmatrix}^T$$ where $$x_t$$ is the $$x$$
coordinate of the agent at timestep $$t$$, $$y_t$$ is the $$y$$ coordinate of the
agent at timestep $$t$$ and $$\theta_t$$ is the orientation of the agent at timestep
$$t$$.

We use the unicycle kinematics vehicle model to represent the vehicle. The
configuration transition equation of the unicycle model is given as:

$$\begin{align}
\dot{x} &= v \cos \theta \\
\dot{y} &= v \sin \theta \\
\dot{\theta} &= \omega
\end{align}
$$

Here we formulate the path optimization problem with the variables as linear
velocities $$v_{t_i}$$ and angualar velocities $$\omega _{t_i}$$ over the time
interval $$[t_i, t_{i+n}]$$. The cost funtion is written as: 

$$\begin{align}
	\displaystyle{\min_{v,w} (x_N(\textbf{v},\textbf{w})
	- x_g)^2 + (y_N(\textbf{v},\textbf{w}) - y_g)^2 +
	(\theta_N(\textbf{v},\textbf{w}) - \theta_g)^2} \end{align}
$$

Here $$x_N$$ is a function that takes the vector of velocities $$\textbf{v}$$ and
angular velocities $$\textbf{w}$$ as input and uses the unicycle kinematics model
of the vehicle to give the $$x$$ coordinate of the vehicle at the $$N$$-th timestep.
The function $$y_N$$ and $$\theta_N$$ gives the $$y$$ and $$\theta$$ of the vehicle in
the $$N$$-th timestep in the same manner. The above cost function ensures that the
$$N$$-th position of the vehicle is the closest to the goal configuration of the
vehicle.

Since the autonomous vehicles have a maximum and minimum velocity, angular
velocity and acceleration and angular acceleration bounds, we add them as bound
constraints to the cost function: 

$$\begin{align}
    v_{min} \leq \mathbf{v}\leq v_{max} \\
    \omega_{min} \leq \boldsymbol{\omega} \leq \omega_{max} \\
    a_{min} \leq \mathbf{a} \leq a_{max} \\
    \alpha_{min} \leq \boldsymbol{\alpha} \leq \alpha_{max}
\end{align}
$$

Usually the obstacles and the agent are represented as circles. The obstacle avoidance constraints are given as:

$$
\begin{align}
d(A_{pos_t}, O^i_{pos_t}) \geq r_a + r^i_o 
\end{align}
$$

Here $$A_{pos_t}$$ is the position of the agent at timestep $$t$$ such that $$1
\leq t \leq T$$ and $$O^i_{pos_t}$$ is position the obstacle $$i$$ at timestep
$$t$$  such that $$1 \leq i \leq N$$ and $$1 \leq t \leq T$$ . $$d(A_{pos_t},
O^i_{pos_t})$$ is the euclidean distance between the agent and obstacle $$i$$ at
timestep $$t$$. $$r_a$$ is the radius of the agent and $$r_o$$ is the radius of
the obstacle. 

### Representing obstacle avoidance constraints as Convex Inner Approximation

The obstacle avoidance constraint mentioned above is non-convex and non-linear
and hence is ill-suited for rapid optimization. To solve for this we take the
Convex Inner Approximation of the constraints that is based on the notion of
free balls.

Let $$\mathscr{O}$$ be the occupied set and $$\underline{d} > 0$$ be the minimum
distance, then the free set $$\mathscr{A}$$ is defined as $$ \mathscr{A} = \{a
\in \mathscr{W}: \Vert a - o \Vert _2 \geq \underline{d},  \forall o \in
\mathscr{O}
\}$$

Here $$\mathscr{W}$$ is the robot's workspace.

The above definition implies that the free set $$\mathscr{A}$$ and the occupied
set $$\mathscr{O}$$ are disjoint.

An obstacle avoidance constraint can now be formulated by making sure that the
robot's position always lies within an n-dimensional ball formed around $$c \in
\mathscr{A}$$.

For an arbitrary free point $$c \in \mathscr{A}$$ we define the free ball as 

$$ \mathscr{A}_c := \{ p \in W : \Vert p - c \Vert _2 \leq d_\mathscr{O}(c) - \underline{d} \}$$

The free ball is a convex subset of the free set $$\mathscr{A}$$.

The collision avoidance constraint $$\Vert p - c \Vert _2 \leq d_\mathscr{O}(c) -
\underline{d}$$ is not differentiable so we square both sides to make it
differentiable. The new constraint looks like this: $$\Vert p - c \Vert _2 ^2
\leq (d_\mathscr{O}(c) - \underline{d})^2$$. $$c$$ represents the free-ball center
points and we need to find them first before solving for the trajectory.

### CIAO Iteration

Given an initial guess $$w$$ where $$w = \begin{bmatrix} x_0^T, u_0^T, \dots,
x_N^T, u_N^T \end{bmatrix}^T$$ is a vector of optimization variables that
contains the stacked controls and states for all $$N$$ steps in the planning
horizon, we find the first set of the center-point vector $$C$$ as

$$
C \leftarrow (c_k \in S_p . x_k \text{ for }k = 0, 1, \dots, N)
$$

Here $$S_p$$ is the selector matrix and we are getiing the $$x_k$$ values from the
initial guess.

The free balls resulting from these center-points might be very small and
restrictive especially if the initial guess is too close to the obstacles. To
solve this issue we maximize the free balls by solving  the optimization problem
for each center-point $$c$$ such that we get the optimal centerpoint $$c^* = \eta
.g + c$$

$$
\begin{align}
	\displaystyle{\max_{\eta \geq 0} \eta \text{ s.t. }
	d_\mathscr{O}(\eta . g + c) = \eta + d_\mathscr{O}(c) } \end{align}
$$

Here $$\eta$$ is the step size and $$g$$ is the search direction with $$\Vert g
\Vert_2 = 1$$

Once we get the center-point vectors we can solve the trajectory optimization problem as 

$$
\begin{align}
    \displaystyle{\min_{\textbf{w},\textbf{s}} J( \textbf{w}) + \sum_{k=0} ^N \mu_k . s_k
    } &\\
    s.t. \text{ } \Vert p - c \Vert _2 ^2  &\leq (d_\mathscr{O}(c) - \underline{d})^2 + s_k
\end{align}
$$

### Advantages

In traditional euclidean distance obstacle avoidance constraints, we estimate
the robot and the obstacles as circles and for every timesteps we make sure that
the distance between the robot and the obstacles are a minimum of the sum of
their radius. Therefore given a set of $$N$$ obstacles, and if we are planning
for $$T$$ timesteps, for every timestep we will have $$N$$ obstacle avoidance
constraints and in total we will have $$N \times T$$ constraints. These are too
many constraints and if the number of obstacles increases then the computation
can't be done in
real-time.

Using CIAO, we will have only $$1$$ obstacle constraint for each timestep. And
for $$T$$ timestep, we will have $$T$$ obstacle avoidance constraints. This
decreases the number of obstacle avoidance constraints significantly and
therefore also improves computation times and as a result is a lot faster.

### Simplified explanation of the CIAO algorithm

The robot's pose is given by the vector $$\begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \\ z
\end{bmatrix}$$. If we are planning for $$T$$ timesteps into the future, we have
$$T$$ such poses.

Let us assume that we know the positions of all the obstacles.

Given a set of $$T$$ poses of the robot which we will call initial guess, we
will first modify these poses such that they are at a distance from the nearest
obstacle from which we can draw the biggest circle possible with the initial
guesses as centers of the circle. We will update the previous initial guesses to
these new poses and we will also keep a record of the radius of the circles.

Now we will compute another set of new poses which will be the robot's pose in
each timestep $$t$$ where $$0 \leq t \leq T$$. These poses will try to be as
close to the center of the circle as possible and will always try to be inside
the radius of the circles. These poses will also be calculated considering
various constraints of the robot like it's maximum velocity limit and maximum
acceleration bounds. 

As long as the robot stays inside the circles, it will avoid the obstacles.

## Conclusion

While the free balls algorithm works really well in complex environment, there
are much to be explored on how we can speed up the computation time to compute
the trajectories more efficiently. One approach would be to come up with better
ways to initialize the optimizer. Another approach can be to make the trajectory
optimization formulation differentiable. Having a differentiable formulation
will enable us to integrate the trajectory computation with the perception
system in an end to end manner.
