The vectors $$v_0, \dots, v_n$$ are said to have linear independence if [ [Linear Cmbination] ]( {% post_url 2022-03-06-linear_combination %} ) of these vectors is $$0$$ only if the coefficients of the linear combination are $$0$$. If the linear combination of the vectors are $$0$$ for coefficients which are not all 0, then the vectors are said to have linear dependency.

Geometrically, the vectors are said to be independent if they don't lie on the
same plane or line.
