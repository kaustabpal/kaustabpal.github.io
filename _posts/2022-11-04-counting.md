Counting applies to probabilistic experiments where we have a finite number of
outcomes and each outocme has the same probability of occuring.

## Basic counting principle

Suppose in an experiment, we have multiple stages. If in stage 1 we have $$m_1$$
outcomes, in stage 2 we have $$m_2$$ outcomes and in stage 3 we have $$m_3$$
outcomes, then the total number of possible outcomes for the experiment are
$$m_1 \times m_2 \times m_3$$

**Example:** How many license plates can we make if the first $$3$$ positions are
alphabets and the last $$4$$ positions are digits?

*Solution:*

Since the first three positions are alphabets, we have $$26$$ choices for the
first position, $$26$$ choices for the second position and $$26$$ choices for
the third position. 
Since the last four positions are digits, we have $$10$$ choices for the fourth
position, $$10$$ choices for the fifth position, $$10$$ choices for the sixth
position and $$10$$ choices for the seventh position.

Therefore in total we have $$26 \times 26 \times 26 \times 10 \times 10 \times
10 \times 10$$ number of license plates possible.

Now **if repitation is not allowed** then in total we have $$26 \times 25 \times
24 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7$$ number of license plates possible.
