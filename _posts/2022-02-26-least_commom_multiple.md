The Least common multiple of a group of numbers is the smallest number that is
divisible by all the numbers. For example, Given two numbers $$3$$ and $$5$$,
the LCM of these two numbers is $$15$$. $$15$$ is the smallest number that is
divisible by both $$3$$ and $$5$$. All the multiples of $$15$$ are also
divisible by those two numbers.

## How to find the LCM of $$n$$ numbers

Least Common Multiple = product of the numbers / [ [Greatest Common Divisor] ](
