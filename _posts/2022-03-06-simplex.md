They are a family of [ [Polyhedron] ]( {% post_url 2022-03-05-polyhedron %} ).
The simplex determined by $$n$$ vectors which have [ [Affine Independence] ]( {%
post_url 2022-03-06-affine_independence %} ) is given by the [ [Convex Hull] ](
{% post_url 2022-02-19-convex_hull %} ) of all the vectors.

It can be written as $$C = \{ \theta_0 v_0 + \theta_1 v_1 + \dots + \theta_k v_k
\mid \theta \succ 0, 1^T\theta = 1\}$$ where $$\theta = \begin{bmatrix} \theta
_1, \theta_2, \dots, \theta_k \end{bmatrix}^T$$ and $$1$$ is a vector of all
ones.
