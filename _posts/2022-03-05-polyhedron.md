A polyhedron can be defined as the intersection of a finite number of linear
equalities and inequalities. They can be represented as $$\{ x \mid Ax \prec
b,  Cx = d \}$$. Since polyhedrons are
intersections of [ [Hyperplane]s ]( {% post_url 2022-02-28-hyperplane %} ) and
[ [Halfspace]s ]( {% post_url 2022-02-28-halfspace %} ) and since we know that
they are [ [Convex Set]s ]( {% post_url 2022-02-19-convex_set %} ) and convex
sets are closed under intersections, we can conclude that polyhedrons are also
convex sets.
