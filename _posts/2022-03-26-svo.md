It is a concept in social psychology that tells us what whether an agent will
allocate the rewards only to itself or to others as well. Knowing the social value
orientation of an agent will help us determine whether that agent will take
actions that benefits itself or others as well. SVOs are reresented as $$\psi$$
in radians.

Some common SVO's are:
1. Altruistic: They only consider other people's reward without caring about
   their own. $$\psi = \dfrac{\pi}{4}$$

2. Prosocial: They takes actions that benefits the group. Their SVO is usually
   $$\psi = \dfrac{\pi}{4}$$

3. Egoistic: They takes actions that only benefits themselves. Whether their
   actions harm or benefits others is of little concern to them. $$\psi =  0$$.

4. Competitive: Competitive agents maximize their relative gains over others.
   $$\psi = -\dfrac{\pi}{4}$$
