A coordinate frame is a set of four vectors that describes the [ [Orientation]
]( {% post_url 2022-02-21-orientation %} ) and [ [Position] ]( {% post_url
2022-02-21-position_vector %} ) of one coordinate system with respect to
another. For example, if we have a coordinate frame $$\{B\}$$ in $$\{A\}$$, then
we can describe $$\{B\}$$ as $$\{^A_BR, ^AP_{Borg}\}$$. Here $$^A_BR$$ describes
the orientation of $$\{B\}$$ with respect to $$\{A\}$$ and $$^AP_{Borg}$$
describes the origin of $$\{B\}$$ with respect to $$\{A\}$$.
