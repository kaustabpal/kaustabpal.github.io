## get_transform() method

Every actor in Carla has a `get_transform()` method that returns the location
and the rotation of the object in the **world coordinates**. While this is
straight forward for vehicles or other actors that we spawn in the world
coordinate system; for sensors it might get a bit confusing. It is because while
spawning the sensors attached to a vehicle, we specify their location and
rotation with respect to the vehicle coordinate system. Thus
`lidar.get_transform()` or `camera.get_transform()` will return their
`carla.Transform` object with respect to the world coordinates.
