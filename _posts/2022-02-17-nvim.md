## Working with multiple files
When we open nvim, what we see is a window in a tab. The window is the viewport
that holds the buffers. When we open a file, we are actually copying the
contents of the file onto a buffer and when we make changes to that copy and 
write ```:w```, the contents of the buffer is written in that file thus changing
it. When we open multiple files each file will open in it's own buffer. The 
window will display only the active buffer while the other buffers will be hidden. 
We can check the files in the buffers with the command ```buffers```. We can switch to
a buffer with the command ```:b<buffer number>```. To close the active
buffer we use the command ```:bd```. To close a hidden buffer we use the command
```:bd<buffer number>```.

A tab can have multiple windows. Thus in a tab we can have multiple windows open
through horizontal split ```:hsplit``` or ```:split``` or vertical split
```:vsplit```.

We can have seperate tabs for each working dir and in those tabs we can have 
windows showing the buffers in that directory. 
But the list of buffers in nvim will be common i.e. there will be a single list
of buffers from which we have to choose which buffer to display in the current
window. Thus when switching buffers in a particular window, it might get 
confusing to choose a buffer from the long list. Need to see with time how 
efficient I get with this.
