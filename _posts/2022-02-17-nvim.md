## Working with multiple files

When we open nvim, what we see is a window in a tab. The window is the viewport
that holds the buffers. When we open a file, we are actually copying the
contents of the file onto a buffer and when we make changes to that copy and 
write `:w`, the contents of the buffer is written in that file thus changing
it. When we open multiple files each file will open in it's own buffer. The 
window will display only the active buffer while the other buffers will be hidden. 
We can check the files in the buffers with the command `buffers`. We can switch to
a buffer with the command `:b<buffer number>`. To close the active
buffer we use the command `:bd`. To close a hidden buffer we use the command
`:bd<buffer number>`. If you didn't write your chabges before closing a
buffer nvim will ask you to first write and then close. If you don't want to
write the changes, you can use the command `:bd!`.

A tab can have multiple windows. Thus in a tab we can have multiple windows open
through horizontal split `:hsplit` or `:split` or vertical split 
`vsplit`.

## Tabs, spaces and end of line
Working with python means being very careful about not having wrong indentations
in your code. While there are plugins that shows indentation line, I wanted to 
achieve that with as much inbuilt commands as possible. Luckily I stumbled upon this
amazing resource [ [Vimcasts] ]( http://vimcasts.org/episodes/page/8/ ).

We can use nvim's list feature to show hidden characters. To turn it on we just
have to execute the command `set list!`. By default it only shows tabs and
leading and trailing spaces. I have configured the `init.vim` file to also show
the `eol` by adding the command `set listchars=tab:▸\
,eol:¬,lead:-,trail:-` to my config file.
